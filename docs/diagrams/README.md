# Diagrams

This folder holds non-Mermaid diagram assets.

- Editable sources: [drawio](drawio)
- Exported images: [png](png)

Preferred workflow:

1) Keep Mermaid diagrams in [../architecture/diagrams.md](../architecture/diagrams.md) as the canonical view.
2) When a diagram needs high-fidelity visuals, add a Draw.io source and export a PNG.
